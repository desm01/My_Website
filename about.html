  <h1>"hello world!"</h1>

  <div class="text-left">


  <p>Hey! I’m an 18 year old student from Northern Ireland and right now I’m studying Computer Science at Queens University.  I’ve decided to create this website so I can showcase my computer science skills and shed light on some personal coding projects that I’ll be working on over the next few years.
</p>
<p>I hope to post articles about current projects that I’m working on (Describing how you can make or modify them to suit your needs) and I will also try to share my thoughts and feelings on the current technological landscape and where I see it heading in the future.
</p>
<p>Simply put, I’m obsessed with all forms of technology and I want to share this on the world wide web!
</p>
<p>I also work as a sports media journalist; I was the creator of the MMA outlet StipeTapped and I freelance for multiple other outlets; offering social media management, photography, writing and video editing services.
